Knowledge graph generated using the [MusicBrainz database](https://beta.musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainz_Database) as main source of the data and [R2RML](https://github.com/amalic/r2rml) to create the graph output files.

The objective of the project was to improve the original data using interlinking between the graph and different open data services like Wikidata and DBpedia with the intention of generating a common base between the three services.

The main outcome is the improvement of the musical genres in the graph by adding new styles and linking the existing artists to the them.
